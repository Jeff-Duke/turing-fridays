## Description

This app provides a much needed service to the Turing staff and community.  Each Friday at Turing School of Software and Design students host personal interest and extracurricular learning groups called spikes.  This app enables any student with a GitHub account to log in to submit a spike proposal to the staff.  Staff can then log in and approve spikes and assign them to classroom locations.  All students can then log in to self-select the spike they have chosen to attend.
